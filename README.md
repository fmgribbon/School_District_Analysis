#School District Analysis
##Project Overview
 
This project used the school district data to provide data-based evidence showing the effects of the 9th grade altered Math and Reading state test scores. 
Several metrics in table format were created from the data provided. 
Two calculations were performed to generate the metrics submitted to the school board. 
The first calculation included all test scores of grades 9th thru 12th .The second calculation excluded the altered 9th grade test scores from Thomas High School.The metrics presented to the school board will be used to determine the extent of the academic dishonesty and uphold the state-testing academic standards. 
##### List of School District Metrics 
  - Summary of the school district's key metrics
  - School performance based on budget per student
  - School performance based on school size 
  - School performance based on type of school
  - Top 5 and bottom 5 schools, based on overall passing rate
  - Average math test score in each grade level
  - Average reading test score in each grade level

After excluding the altered 9th Grade Math and Reading Test Scores from Thomas High School, below were the results:

- The school districts average Math score, passing Rate for Reading and Math have decreased. 
- The school test results performance based on budget, school size, and school type remained unchanged.  
  - **School district performance based on:**
      - Budget per student: Thomas High School budget per student is $638. It falls in the range of $630 – 644. The average test scores remained the unchanged for schools with a budget in the range of $630 – 644.
      - School Size: Thomas High School have 1,635 students. It falls in the midsize (1000-2000). The average test scores remained the unchanged for midsize schools like Thomas High School.
      - School Type: Thomas High School is a Charter School. The average test scores remained the unchanged for Charter schools like Thomas High School.
##Summary
To determine the impact of the altered 9th grade Math and Reading test score from Thomas High School, two calculations were done. The results of the two calculations showed that the difference between the initial calculation and the recalculation was down by a hundredth. 
The impact of not including the altered 9th grade test score has an insignificant effect in the overall test result scores of the school district.
The performance of the schools in the district remained unchanged due to the whole number rounding of the average scores and passing rates. The population of the Thomas High School is a very small fraction of the total population of the school district and thus will have an insignificant effect in the overall school district performance. The analysis performed shows that the academic standards of the state testing remains unchanged as seen on the reports presented.
